Respository for OK Cupid Data Analysis (Econometrics Class)

Team project looking at the instances of swear words in OK Cupid profiles. We set ourselves the challenge to see if there were any clear factors which indicated whether an individual was more likely to swear. My part of the work involved cleaning the data and filtering the profiles which contained swear words.

Respoitory contains team's final presentation.
